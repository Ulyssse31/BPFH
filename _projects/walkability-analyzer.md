## Overview

The Walkability Analyzer is an open-source tool that helps urban planners and citizens understand how pedestrian-friendly their neighborhoods are.

## Key Metrics

The tool analyzes:

- Sidewalk coverage and quality
- Street connectivity and route options
- Distance to essential services
- Pedestrian safety features
- Green space accessibility

## How It Works

2. The tool queries OpenStreetMap data
3. Algorithms calculate walkability scores
4. Results are displayed with interactive maps and charts

## Use Cases

- Urban planning departments assessing infrastructure needs
- Real estate developers evaluating locations
- Community advocates pushing for pedestrian improvements
- Residents making informed housing decisions

## Open Source

This project is open source and welcomes contributions from developers and urban planning enthusiasts.

## Results

Cities using this tool have identified priority areas for sidewalk improvements and successfully advocated for pedestrian infrastructure funding.
